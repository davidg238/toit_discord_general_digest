Hello again,  
I was reading your README and you mention  
```build/host/sdk/tools/firmware -e build/esp32/firmware.envelope  container install hello hello.snapshot```  
Can we install more than one container in this envelope? Do you have any docs explaining how these envelopes work? very interesting. Thanks  

#### kasperl
This is very new stuff, but yes you can have multiple containers in a firmware envelope.  
Next step is to make it easier to work -- probably from Jaguar.  
You can also add assets to these containers if you need to provide them with credentials or extra data.
