tasks are very light? (the overhead of just the task itself, not what goes on inside it, is low?)

Yes. Tasks are light. The execution stack for a task takes up space, but we grow it dynamically to save space.  
50-100 words is enough for some workloads, but sometimes you need more if you have a good chunk of recursion.
