Question regarding the RTC: I presume I have to do the following, say once a day, to keep the time accurate and to pick up daylight saving time changes?
[1:57 PM]
result ::= ntp.synchronize --network=network
 if result: adjust_real_time_clock result.adjustment

Daylight saving changes are based on the timezone. They are unaffected by NTP.
But yes, it's recommended to update the clock from time to time (no pin intended). Whether that needs to be every day I don't know (edited)
