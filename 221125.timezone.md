It there a way to change the TimeZone on a device?  

#### floitsch
Yes.  
Which version? v1 or v2?  

#### pjordan
V1  

#### floitsch
```
import core.time_impl show set_tz_

main:
  set_tz_ "<some rules>"
```

Valid TZ values can be easily obtained by looking at the last line of the
  zoneinfo files on Linux machines:
```
tail -n1 /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/Copenhagen
```
For example: `CET-1CEST,M3.5.0,M10.5.0/3`  

Looks like this page has a list as well: https://sites.google.com/a/usapiens.com/opnode/time-zones
