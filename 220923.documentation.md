In general, I recommend the following approach when looking for documentation:  
- search on libs.toit.io  
- search on docs.toit.io  
- ctrl-click on interesting library functions and browse/skim the library code. (If you ctrl-click on hardware_id in vscode you should see the library source code. At least if vscode is set up correctly).  
- ask on stack-overflow, github discussions, or here.  stack-overflow have the longest lifetime and are thus best for questions that could be interesting in the future. github discussions is a forum and thus also "permanent". It probably has a faster response time. Discord is a chat and thus faster. For fast simple "which function does X" discord is probably best.
