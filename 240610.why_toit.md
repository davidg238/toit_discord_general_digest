Fundamentally, we wanted a language we enjoy coding in.
That includes:
garbage collection
relatively high-level (to be more productive)
consistency (good naming, ...)

At the same time, we needed to have something that is stable and production ready.
Python is hard to optimize, and MicroPython was too slow and unstable (memory-wise) to us. Also: we did want to have some types in the system. While Toit isn't fully typed, it has enough types that writing bigger programs works without issues (at least for us). More types also help the LSP server to provide better feedback.
