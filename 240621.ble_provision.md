Hi Floitsch, I have been testing version 2.0. Thank you very much for investing your time in this package. The initial tests seem to work correctly, but I have encountered this. When the userproof is incorrect, it throws an exception that stops the program. I believe it is also internal, and I cannot catch it. Thanks!

```

Ah. I didn't think of that and didn't test it.
Will fix it soon (but maybe only on Monday or so).

I have another question: does prov.wait return control to the program only when it successfully connects to the WiFi? What happens if the WiFi password entered is incorrect? Can the main program not react to that? Thanks.

floitsch — 06/21/2024 12:54 PM
Currently it can't. My thinking was that the user can just try again. 
I can add a callback if you think that's useful.

Ipotex — 06/21/2024 1:00 PM
I thought prov.wait returned null if it couldn't connect. It would be nice if it returned the reason, for example, incorrect password, but even returning null would allow you to give some indication to the user that something is wrong. Otherwise, the only way would be to set a timer, and if it doesn't connect after 60 seconds, show some indicator to the user to retry. Otherwise, the user wouldn't know when to retry or what is happening.

The user has a phone where they get a reason for what happened
[1:01 PM]
So when things don't work the error is sent through the BLE to the user.

Ipotex — 06/21/2024 1:04 PM
I didn't say anything then. I didn't know the status was sent to the phone via Bluetooth; I thought you had to send it yourself.

floitsch — 06/21/2024 1:05 PM
That's fortunately not necessary.
[1:06 PM]
If you come up with another good reason I can still add a callback, but I found the current setup easier. 

Might still be nice to know that someone is trying to connect so that you don't shut it down just then. 

```

import provision
import net
import esp32

class MyBLEProvision:
  sec2Salt_ /ByteArray := #[]
  sec2Verifier_ /ByteArray := #[]
  userName_ /string := "wifiprov"
  userKey_ /string := "abcd1234"
  
  constructor --salt/ByteArray  --verifier/ByteArray --username/string --userKey/string:
    this.sec2Salt_ = salt
    this.sec2Verifier_= verifier
    this.userName_ = username
    this.userKey_ = userKey

  start:
    id := esp32.mac-address[3..]
    service-name := "MCM" + (hex.encode id)

    credentials := provision.SecurityCredentials.scheme2
      --salt=sec2Salt_
      --verifier=sec2Verifier_

    prov := provision.Provision service-name --security-credentials=credentials

    prov.start

    print note*/  
    
    wifi-credentials := prov.wait   
    print "Provisioning is successful. Wifi credentials $wifi-credentials"
    prov.close


main:
  provision := MyBLEProvision --salt=#[] --verifier=#[] --username="" --userKey=""
```

I have another question. Is there a way to know if the device has stored WiFi values to decide whether to go directly to the provisioning container or continue with the connection to the backend? Thank you.

I would need to check, but you can always store the state in flash yourself (https://libs.toit.io/system/storage/library-summary).

The idea would be to run the provision tool when nothing is in the flash and update the state (yourself) when you have the credentials.

You probably still want to have a way to restart it (for example when a button is pressed), so users can set it up again when they change wifi.
