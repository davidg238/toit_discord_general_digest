The way to make this work is to implement a service that handles logging/printing. (edited)
Here is a tutorial for services: https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/containers/services
And here is the LogService: https://libs.toit.io/system/api/log/class-LogService
And for print it's here: https://libs.toit.io/system/api/print/class-PrintService
There are two tests that could be interesting:

Note that you can use print_ to directly print to the UART without going through any service.
