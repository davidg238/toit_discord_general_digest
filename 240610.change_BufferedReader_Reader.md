I see BufferedReader is deprecated, and it suggests using io.Reader. I don't see functions equivalent to .byte, .bytes and .read_bytes_until in the new io.Reader  These funcions are used by the old cellular package which works way better for us, than new update package. Am I using the wrong io.Reader?

It's peek-byte, peek-bytes now.
The read-bytes-until is now read-bytes-up-to

Ah okay, new names  thanks. 

Also the new uart write function doesn't return bytes written like the old one did. It's in lib/uart.toit line 363. I fixed it already, because the desc says it should return the written bytes.

you can use try-write

So uart.write wasn't guaranteed to write everything.
Now it is.

Before the migration you were required to keep track of the amount of bytes written and retry if some bytes weren't written yet.
Now, you don't need to do that anymore.
[1:58 AM]
If you want to do it, you can use uart.try-write.
[1:58 AM]
(That's what write uses under the hood).
[1:59 AM]
I wouldn't be surprised if your code gets the amount of written bytes to retry if not everything was written. If that's the case you can simplify your code and remove that loop.

I will also change the Uart class to return the amount of bytes written.
