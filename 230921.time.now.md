Looks like Time.now also reports milliseconds as default

It doesnt follow the 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z format anymore

Do you need a way to drop the more precise output?

We use 2019-12-18T06:22:48Z format, and I dont see a way to drop the ms from time.now

In the worst case you can always construct the string by hand.

kasperl — Today at 12:07 AM
print (Time.now.utc.with --ns=0)

Here I am sking Time.now to convert itself to a UTC time (this is the default way to convert a Time instance to a string). Then I ask the UTC time (a TimeInfo instance) to give me a copy of itself with the fraction set to zero (with --ns=0).
