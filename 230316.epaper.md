There were several epaper drivers in Toit, but they have bit-rotted because nobody uses them.
In Toit 1 (closed source) the graphics drivers were inside the system and could not be written
by users.  Now they are open, and the TFT and OLED drivers have been opened up, but the
epaper drivers were just dumped in a repo and not updated.

I don't think they work right now.  There's a 3-color driver, and the pixel-display library has support for more colors.  There's a several-color mode, which generates the graphics in a 1-byte-per-pixel array.  This was used for a 7-color display at some point - I don't remember the details.

One issue is that there are lots of different e-paper hardwares, and they are all very similar, but slightly different.  The samples I have are not labelled - I was not systematic enought about it.  And now I'm not sure exactly which ones I have, which makes it hard to debug and also hard to release anything.  Even if I get something working I'm not sure what I got working
