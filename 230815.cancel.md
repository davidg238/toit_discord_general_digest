Hi Team!
I am going through the services tutorial. I can see two keywords that I can not find an explanation / documentation for. One of them is run and the next is critical_do. Is there any languge documentation that can introduce these to me? VSCode highlight does highlight run like is highlighted in the documentation.

Another thing I noticed is if I declate a_variable, vscode autocompletion suggests a-variable everytime I want to access it, and it always works! (edited)

run is just a method name, like sleep or receive.

Is there a place where I can get the list of methods?

kasperl — 08/15/2023 3:07 AM
critical_do is also just a method, but that probably deserves a good explanation. It tells the system to call the code block in a special mode where things that may block continue to work even if called while the task is being canceled.

In this case, you're defining the run method in the example code.

The other methods are pulled in through libraries and packages. You can see the methods in the core library (implicitly imported) here: https://libs.toit.io/core/library-summary.

just one more thing, what are critical blocks?


kasperl — 08/15/2023 3:12 AM
Blocks are snippets of code that you pass to methods.
[3:13 AM]
You define them using : and an indented sequence of statements.

raveesh-me — 08/15/2023 3:13 AM
I uderstand blocks, I want to know the significance of critical

kasperl — 08/15/2023 3:13 AM
So a block is critical if it needs to run even if the task that executes it is being canceled.
[3:14 AM]
Cancelation is very useful, but also somewhat tricky, because it requires a task to stop running code and return out at well-defined points.

raveesh-me — 08/15/2023 3:14 AM
that makes sense. like what then/finally is supposed to do in dart? (edited)

kasperl — 08/15/2023 3:14 AM
Often you may need some clean up to happen in a finally block, and that is typically where you'll see critical_do.
[3:15 AM]
Yeah, kinda, but cancelation works by letting a task continue to run until it hits a blocking point and then stopping (unwinding) from there.

raveesh-me — 08/15/2023 3:16 AM
Is there a resource that would allow me to read up more on cancellation?

kasperl — 08/15/2023 3:17 AM
Very good question. The documentation at https://libs.toit.io/core/task/class-Task#cancel(0%2C0%2C0%2C) is pretty sparse.
[3:18 AM]
The example you sent just now illustrates the cancelation. The sending task will continue to run until canceled from the outside.

raveesh-me — 08/15/2023 3:20 AM
This explains a lot! Now I can finally understand the whole example.
