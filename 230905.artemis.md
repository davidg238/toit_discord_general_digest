That said: Erik changed the esp32-no-ble a bit, so it should also run a bit faster.

(more of the Toit functions in IRAM)

in theory that could make the program finish faster and thus consume less energy.
[1:46 PM]
but realistically you probably won't see any difference.

WiFi is just too power hungry for that.
[1:49 PM]
If you need to improve on energy:
make sure that the connection to WiFi is as short as possible. (net.open and net.close).
Don't connect multiple times in one "session". (if necessary coordinate the net.open).
You can use the artemis package to make Artemis connect to the server (to look for updates). This way you can also make Artemis use the existing WiFi connection.

How do I do that?

Have a look here:
https://pkg.toit.io/github.com/toitware/toit-artemis@0.7.0/docs/artemis/library-summary#run(2%2C1%2C0%2Conline)

If you have Artemis set to max-offline 2h, but use this function to connect every 1h50m then Artemis wouldn't establish a connection on its own.

Note: you would run the Artemis synchronization at the same time as your code, so there would be a bit more memory pressure.
