I am receiving an exception when I try to decode base64 with this encoded part: eyJhbGciOiJFRDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0

but this should be a totally fine encoded string - I tried to decode it online with a decoder and it works
[6:34 AM]
decoded json:
{
  "alg": "ED25519",
  "typ": "JWT"
}

Might be an additional newline or something.

our base64 decoder is quite picky...

@Rikke
I guess i still need some changes to services to make them work 

floitsch — Today at 6:38 AM
If you haven't seen. There is a tutorial on services: https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/containers/services

is there a way to trim and remove any unneccessary symbol?

floitsch — Today at 6:39 AM
You can try .trim to remove whitespace. But I'm not sure that was the only thing.
I was once hitting a similar issue, and remember that the decoder was correct but not very helpful. (edited)

I think they are working now thanks, I was just missing the .open on clients

I tried: json.decode "eyJhbGciOiJFRDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0".to-byte-array and it still crashes. I will encode the json now again and see if that helps

floitsch — Today at 6:52 AM
This is not json.
[6:52 AM]
You first need to base64 decode.
[6:53 AM]
ᐅ toit.run /tmp/t.toit
{alg: ED25519, typ: JWT}
ᐅ cat /tmp/t.toit
import encoding.base64
import encoding.json

main:
  print (json.decode (base64.decode "eyJhbGciOiJFRDI1NTE5IiwidHlwIjoiSldUIn0="))
[6:54 AM]
The trailing = is necessary, even though some (online) decoders just assume it when it's missing. That's probably what I hit last time as well.
[6:54 AM]
Also note: there is a jwt package.
[6:56 AM]
Looks like it's not supporting ED255519, though. (At least not yet)
[6:56 AM]
Apparently you can drop the = if you pass the --url-mode flag to base64.decode. (edited)

String based data encoding: Base64 vs Base64url
What is the difference between Base64 and Base64url that I see in things like JSON web tokens?


Informatic0re — Today at 6:58 AM
so I checked it and the = is missing

floitsch — Today at 6:58 AM
It's probably base64url and not base64.

Informatic0re — Today at 6:59 AM
I do not really use jwt I simply split the payload at . and only use the first part as header to check if it says tap: JWT

floitsch — Today at 6:59 AM
Looking at the jwt.io page the content seems to be base64url.

Informatic0re — Today at 6:59 AM
so if I set url enabled it ignores this = sign?

floitsch — Today at 6:59 AM
So you should definitely use that flag.

Informatic0re — Today at 6:59 AM
ah okay

floitsch — Today at 6:59 AM
The trailing = is optional when using base64url.
[7:00 AM]
It also uses a slightly different set of characters.
