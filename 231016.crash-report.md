Assuming that there is a crash and you're not capturing the traces yourself (by hooking into the stack trace reporting facility) and storing them, I think we only print them via serial. It feels like making it easier to capture such traces and find them on reboot (and maybe send them out via mqtt) would be nice. It is perfectly doable. Also, watchdogs in case you actually don't have a crash on your hands here, but rather a live- or deadlock.

If you reboot it, it will be very interesting to hear if it manages to go back online. Then we should have a chat about how to capture this information and make it available to you. Artemis could potentially just do this for you, so you don't have to worry so much about it.
