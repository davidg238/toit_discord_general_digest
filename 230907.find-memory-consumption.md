The best is to figure out where the memory is going.
You can use:
print-objects: https://libs.toit.io/core/utils/library-summary#print_objects(2%2C0%2C0%2C)
process-stats: https://libs.toit.io/core/utils/library-summary#process_stats(2%2C0%2C0%2Cgc)
dump-heap: https://libs.toit.io/esp32/library-summary#dump_heap(0%2C0%2C0%2C)

print-objects helps you to figure out which objects in your own heap take up space.
process-stats helps you to track changes in memory and when GCs happen, ...
dump-heap is for global "who is using memory".
