Hi, does the Toit runtime use HTTP or TCP to connect to the Toit cloud service? I'm wondering if it's possible to get Toit communicating with a Blues Wireless Notecard cellular module which only exposes a JSON API for communication. It's possible to make long RTT http GET and POST requests through the json api but obviously Toit would have to allow me to write a shim between Toit and Blues. Thanks!  

#### floitsch
Toit has an http package that allows you to do GET/POST requests: https://pkg.toit.io/package/github.com%2Ftoitlang%2Fpkg-http  
Erik has actually been working on it this week and improved it quite a bit. (Not all PRs have landed yet, I think).  
As usual for packages, you have examples in the examples folder of the repository.  
  
https://github.com/toitlang/pkg-http/tree/main/examples  
  
Not sure if that's your goal, but you should even be able to make the communication through such a module transparent for other applications.  
Since Toit supports cellular drivers (nb-iot), which communicate over AT commands, it might be possible to abstract away the communication with the Blues Wireless Notecard.  
That said; I haven't really looked into the functioning of the Blues module.  

#### Carlton
Yeah, the Notecard doesn't allow AT Commands. It handles all the AT stuff and only exposes JSON and a simplified subset of HTTP.  

#### floitsch
how are you supposed to communicate with it? Over uart?  

#### Carlton
Yeah Uart, i2c, serial

#### floitsch
I'm looking through the http code right now.  
Might be that the easiest is to create a fake Network.  
When you create an http-client you can give it a net.Interface as parameter  
  
https://libs.toit.io/net/class-Interface
  
You can then just implement the few methods you need, mapping the Socket functionality to the way you talk to the Blues.  
So, for example, if you use Uart, you would implement tcp_connect host port (probably just ignoring the parameters), and return your UartSocket class which then needs to have a few methods, but mainly read and write.  
Does that make sense?  
Looping in @erikcorry , just in case he has a better idea.  

#### Carlton
Ok, so you suggest tunneling at the TCP layer. Makes sense.  

#### floitsch
```
import net
import net.tcp as tcp
import uart

class UartInterface implements net.Interface:
  port_/uart.Port

  constructor .port_:

  tcp_connect host port -> tcp.Socket:
    return UartSocket port_
  
  address: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  is_closed: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  close:  // do nothing.
  resolve host: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  udp_open --port=null: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  tcp_connect address: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  tcp_listen port: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"


class UartSocket implements tcp.Socket:
  port_/uart.Port

  constructor .port_:

  read -> ByteArray?:
    return port_.read

  write data -> int:
    return port_.write data
```

I'm thinking of something like this.  
You can then give this to http client in the constructor.  
Could be that you need to implement a few more of the unimplemented methods, but looking through the client.toit code the tcp_connect function is the only one that is needed.
