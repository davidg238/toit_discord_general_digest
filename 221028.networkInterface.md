import net
import net.tcp as tcp
import uart

class UartInterface implements net.Interface:
  port_/uart.Port

  constructor .port_:

  tcp_connect host port -> tcp.Socket:
    return UartSocket port_
  
  address: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  is_closed: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  close:  // do nothing.
  resolve host: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  udp_open --port=null: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  tcp_connect address: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"
  tcp_listen port: throw "UNIMPLEMENTED"


class UartSocket implements tcp.Socket:
  port_/uart.Port

  constructor .port_:

  read -> ByteArray?:
    return port_.read

  write data -> int:
    return port_.write data
```

I'm thinking of something like this.  
You can then give this to http client in the constructor.  
Could be that you need to implement a few more of the unimplemented methods, but looking through the client.toit code the tcp_connect function is the only one that is needed.
