"Applications communicate with each other through publish/subscribe (PubSub)..."  
  
"PubSub can be used internally on devices through the PubSub library and externally..."  

Question: Is PubSub the preferred method to communicate between Containers?  
  
(The PubSub Library link is "Error: Library pubsub not found".)

It might be cool to start iterating on a design for a Toit v2 pubsub replacement -- because using a message bus is still a pretty useful way to coordinate the work of multiple containers.  
I hacked up the core basics of this here: https://gist.github.com/kasperl/93aa561cf24f6430d0440ea01bd3e5c2.  
The core idea is to run a pubsub "broker" of sorts in a separate process and let it handle subscribe/publish calls via the RPC/service mechanisms.  
It then uses the notification support to send published messages to subscribers across process boundaries.  
I think this could turn into a useful package
