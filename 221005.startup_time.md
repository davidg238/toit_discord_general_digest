Hi, I am thinking about using toit for a project that has a hard real-time requirement for the startup time below 1 second. How long does it take to start executing the first toit program/VM?  
(ESP32 standard chip)  

#### floitsch
Should be plenty of time. Let me make a small example to test start-up time.  
```
main:
  print Time.monotonic_us
```
The monotonic_us is reset at start, when the device is powered on.  
The output I get is: 93950  
There might be a bit more overhead for the ESP32 booting up, but I'm pretty sure it's below 1s.  
and the monotonic_us might even include that time.  

#### @3589810 
I could also take a second esp32 and measure the time it takes for the device to wake-up from deep-sleep (which is equivalent to reboot) and it setting a pin.  
I'm pretty sure it would be pretty much the same.  

#### kasperl
Deep sleep wakeup is likely faster. The bootloader spends extra time on full reboots verifying checksums.  
(it's pretty significant)

Nice! Thank you for the quick response. -- Phil

```
import esp32
import gpio

main:
  pin := gpio.Pin 27 --output
  pin.set 1
  print "sleeping 20s"
  sleep --ms=20_000
  print "going to sleep. wakeup with pin 18"
  esp32.enable_external_wakeup (1 << 26) true
  esp32.deep_sleep (Duration --h=24)
```
```
import gpio

main:
  in := gpio.Pin 26 --input --pull_down
  out := gpio.Pin 27 --output

  in.configure --input --pull_down

  now := Time.monotonic_us
  out.set 1
  in.wait_for 1
  done := Time.monotonic_us

  print "Took: $(done - now)us"
```
Took: 175880us  
So 176ms from getting a signal on a pin to wake up from deep sleep, until setting a different pin in Toit.  
If you need to start up from a power-on it might be slightly more, but not that much.
